## Inpact on banking industry

- https://www.wolfandco.com/resources/insights/how-cryptocurrencies-may-impact-the-banking-industry/
- [Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_the_Comptroller_of_the_Currency)
   - puts blockchain networks in the same category as SWIFT, ACH, and FedWire
- digital currencies can offer many benefits to financial institutions and their customers

### Why Banks are Cautious of Cryptocurrencies

#### Decentralized Nature

- Crypto created as an alternative to traditional **centralized** banking infrastructure
   - The trust is placed in the blockchain code and the **distributed** nature of the blockchain
- The decentralized nature of the currency is seen to undermine the authority of central banks, leaving some to believe that they won’t be needed anymore, or they’ll be unable to control the money supply.

#### AML/KYC Concerns

- Cryptocurrencies allow for peer-to-peer transactions without a regulated intermediary
- giving the user the ability to easily transfer funds quickly without having to pay transaction fees
- Instead of identifying the transaction by an individual bank account through a financial institution, transactions are simply linked to the transaction ID on the blockchain
- This type of pseudonymity worries many banks who are concerned about the lack of **Anti-Money Laundering** (AML) and **Know Your Customer** (KYC) regulations surrounding digital currency transactions

#### Volatility

- The price of cryptocurrencies (bitcoin specifically) have generally been volatile over their short life
- There are many reasons for this including market size, liquidity, and the number of market participants
- Banks see this as a risk

### How Banks Can Get Involved in the Cryptocurrency Industry

> Banks need to find a way to embrace this technology and treat it as a friend rather than an enemy. Cryptocurrency adoption could streamline, enhance, and upgrade financial services.

#### Custody Services

- The OCC stated that banks and savings associations could provide crypto custody services for customers, including holding unique cryptographic keys associated with accessing private wallets

#### Easy Onboarding & Expert Assistance

- Banks could help bring new, less experienced individual investors into the space by developing tools that would facilitate the adoption of crypto by their customers
- Banks might relieve some of the stress of investors that aren’t experts in the nuances of crypto by acting as a trusted third party

#### AML/KYC Regulations Administered

- The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network’s (FinCEN) determined that any cryptocurrency transactions and custody services conducted through crypto entities that are considered money service businesses must still abide by AML/KYC regulations
- There’s even a possibility that blockchain technology could automate AML and KYC verifications

#### Security Concerns

- Well-established banks could help secure digital currencies from theft or hacks, putting clients’ minds at ease

#### Payments

- Blockchain technology provides a faster and less expensive alternative to clearing houses when processing transactions.

#### Smart Contracts

- When entering into an agreement through a smart contract, there’s a reduced level of trust needed among parties because the success of the transaction relies on computer code instead of an individual’s behavior
- Banks could reinforce that trust by becoming a reliable third party

- Concerns surrounding the security and stability of cryptocurrency also hold banks back from entering this space
- potential for criminal activity
- potential for economic growth
- Financial institutions should shift from thinking of crypto as a competitor to that of a partner
- Banks can actually play a significant role in the crypto industry, adding some much needed assurance and security to the largely unregulated environment
