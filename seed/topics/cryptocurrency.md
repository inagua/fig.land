### Why Banks are Cautious of Cryptocurrencies

#### Decentralized Nature

- Crypto created as an alternative to traditional **centralized** banking infrastructure
   - The trust is placed in the blockchain code and the **distributed** nature of the blockchain
- The decentralized nature of the currency is seen to undermine the authority of central banks, leaving some to believe that they won’t be needed anymore, or they’ll be unable to control the money supply.

#### AML/KYC Concerns

- Cryptocurrencies allow for peer-to-peer transactions without a regulated intermediary
- giving the user the ability to easily transfer funds quickly without having to pay transaction fees
- Instead of identifying the transaction by an individual bank account through a financial institution, transactions are simply linked to the transaction ID on the blockchain
- This type of pseudonymity worries many banks who are concerned about the lack of **Anti-Money Laundering** (AML) and **Know Your Customer** (KYC) regulations surrounding digital currency transactions

#### Volatility

- The price of cryptocurrencies (bitcoin specifically) have generally been volatile over their short life
- There are many reasons for this including market size, liquidity, and the number of market participants
- Banks see this as a risk
